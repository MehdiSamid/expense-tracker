# Angular Expense Tracker

Welcome to the Angular Expense Tracker project!

## Overview

Angular Expense Tracker is a collaborative effort among three developers to create a sleek and efficient expense tracking application using Angular. Our goal is to challenge ourselves by applying solid principles and design patterns such as Angular's own conventions, as well as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture.

## Key Features

- **Simplified Expense Management**: Easily add, edit, and delete expenses.
- **User Authentication**: Sign in and sign up functionality to manage user accounts.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures usability across various devices.
- **LocalStorage Data Storage**: Securely stores expense data locally.

## Project Goals

Our primary goal with this project is to challenge ourselves to create a high-quality application within a tight timeframe of just two days. Additionally, we aim to hone our team management skills by implementing the Scrum framework for project management.

## Usage

1. Upon launching the application, you'll be greeted with the signin/signup interface.
2. Sign up for a new account if you're a new user, or sign in with your existing credentials.
3. Once signed in, you can use the provided functionality to add, edit, or delete expenses as needed.
4. Your expense data is securely stored locally using LocalStorage.
